Alternatives / improvements

1) Rather than trying the max pooling layer, we can use a stride of 2 during convolution. Maxpool reduces the size of the feature map by taking the maximum activation with a certain kernel size which might lead to loss of important features as well. To reduce the size as well as preserve some important features, we can use a stride of 2.

2) Rather than using a 512x 512 image, we can design a network that can take any size input and create a specific output feature map. For example, something like Spatial Pyramid Pooling Network(SPPnet) 

Drawback

1)The DRIMB dataset seems to be from the same distribution. Therefore, the model learnt will not be able to generalize to a dataset from a different distribution. A bit more data of varying resolution, size etc would help generalization better
